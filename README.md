# Supply-Chain-Late-Delivery-Risk-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project predicts late deliveries in supply chains using Machine Learning. Using XGBoost (ROC-AUC 0.80), it identifies high-risk shipments based on factors like discount offered, product weight, and shipment mode. The model helps businesses reduce delays, improve logistics efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction.
🚚 Supply Chain Late Delivery Risk Prediction (ML Project)
📦 Predicting Delivery Delays Using Machine Learning & XGBoost

This project uses Machine Learning to predict late shipment deliveries and help businesses improve supply-chain planning, reduce delays, and enhance customer satisfaction.
The model analyzes shipping data and identifies high-risk orders before delays occur.
