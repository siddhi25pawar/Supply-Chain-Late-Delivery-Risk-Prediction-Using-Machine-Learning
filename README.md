# Supply-Chain-Late-Delivery-Risk-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project predicts late deliveries in supply chains using Machine Learning. Using XGBoost (ROC-AUC 0.80), it identifies high-risk shipments based on factors like discount offered, product weight, and shipment mode. The model helps businesses reduce delays, improve logistics efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction.
